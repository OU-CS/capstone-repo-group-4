## Design Files

We created our design files through sketch. [You can view that here](https://www.sketch.com/s/ed5ea759-9409-4c5e-8929-5a1bfbccd230)

## Project Management 

We are tracking and organizing our workflows using Clubhouse https://app.clubhouse.io/invite-link/601c6b8f-9db1-4fc6-ab7d-56763f47fb99

## Testing

Our group initially planned to implement integrated tests along with unit testing as we continued to code throughout the project. We discovered these types of test were slowing down speed of development and were non beneficial considering the time cost. The group is now testing the basic functionality of each added process by deploying to our Global AWS Stack and then using tools such as Postman and Datagrip to test endpoints and database states. 

Eventually the group hopes to conduct acceptance criteria testing with potential users of the product and the project client however the group is far away from conducting such tests and will likely include those as stretch goals
