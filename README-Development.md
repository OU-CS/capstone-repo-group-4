# Development

Our group feels very satisfied with the progress of this application. Our group initially set out to make a 2 sided marketplace that allows buyers and sellers to make land reservations. We eventually switched to a one-sided dashboard that allows logged-in users to both reserve and post land leases to cover the 2 sided criteria but minimize complexity. The group was able to accomplish most of what we set out to do. We have coded both frontend and backend infrastructure for this app that is now almost fully functional. All our code is being hosted on the free tier of Amazon Web Services and is currently live and up to date. The group feels as though we have succeeded in the attempt of making a fully functional minimally viable product and are comfortable with progress. The application uses various deployed resources such as multiple API endpoints, relation database system, functional hosted frontend, and a user authentication service called Cognito. All the services the team used are through Amazon Web Services and the team feels as though they've learned a great deal about serverless applications.

## Tech Stack

Most of the tech stack is built using Typescript, The front end is powered by Next.js, and there bits of SQL here and there to communicate with the database.

## Future Directions

There are of course some things the team would like to have gotten done but eventually became outside of the scope of the original project. One thing that the team would have liked to accomplish that it initially set out to was some form of mobile features that let you track your current location in relation to a certain property that you were on. Another feature might have been some form of direct person-to-person communication through the platform allowing guests to communicate with the hosts they were renting from. The group set out to complete the core functionality of this application and inevitably had to cut some "nice to have" features. If the team were given more time or were to continue with the development of this project following the end of the capstone class, the group would choose to primarily focus on these features making the application more mobile-friendly and accessible.

## Code Handoff

Logan is a graduating business student and our group's client contact for building this product. Logan does plan to continue pursuing the creation of a business centered around the technology concept that the team worked on but will likely have to update and revamp much of the code. Due to all of the code already being hosted on AWS the code handoff should be very simple. After a few meetings with Logan and documentation and explanation of the different parts of the code, we should be able to share the GitHub drive with him as well as the credentials to the AWS service and he can take the code on to whatever future plans he has for it. The hosting on AWS allows Logan to use the current website as an MVP without having to modify the code at all and therefore a safe transition of development beyond the capstone team.
